# Indented Sass syntax highlighting, autocomplete & snippets for VSCode
VSCode only has built in support for SCSS syntax so I have put this together for people who prefer to use the indented syntax.

![Highlighting Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robinbentley/vscode-sass-indented/master/images/screenshot.png)

## Installing
Search for Sass from the extension installer within VSCode or put this into the command palette.
```
ext install sass-indented
```

## Property/Value Autocompletion & Emmet
Autocompletion for css properties and built in language functions _(@warn, @at-root, lighten(), darken() etc)_ is built in. As of version 1.3 VSCode supports Emmet in .sass files, the original snippets for css properties have been removed.

## Snippets
Snippets have been reduced to a few time savers.

`var` - declare a new variable   
`mixin` - declare a new mixin   
`if` - base for an @if statement   
`for` - base for a @for loop   
`each` - base for a @each loop   
`while` - base for a @while loop
