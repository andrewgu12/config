## Install

  `M-x package-install RET doom-themes`

A comprehensive configuration example:

  (require 'doom-themes)

  ;; Global settings (defaults)
  (setq doom-themes-enable-bold t    ; if nil, bold is universally disabled
        doom-themes-enable-italic t) ; if nil, italics is universally disabled

  ;; Load the theme (doom-one, doom-molokai, etc); keep in mind that each
  ;; theme may have their own settings.
  (load-theme 'doom-one t)

  ;; Enable flashing mode-line on errors
  (doom-themes-visual-bell-config)

  ;; Enable custom neotree theme
  (doom-themes-neotree-config)  ; all-the-icons fonts must be installed!
