## Syntax Highlighting is bad

Since v12, we're discontinuing our grammar in favor of
<https://github.com/atom/language-typescript>, which is itself
downstream from <https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-TmLanguage>.

General grammar issues should go to
<https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-TmLanguage>, and ones specific
to Atom to <https://github.com/atom/language-typescript>.

## Atom can't find modules/files that I just added

## Atom complains about errors that shouldn't happen with my tsconfig on new files

Tsserver can be lazy in reindexing project files for performance
reasons. You can manually tell it to refresh by running
`typescript:reload-projects` command

## Which version of TypeScript does atom-typescript use?

Your current version installed in your `node_modules`. This gets
determined once per open file so you might want to re-open your panes,
if you've updated Typescript in your project.

## Atom Typescript is complaining about not finding files or other weird errors

You probably deleted them or added them or moved them around. The
Typescript compiler is decent about keeping track of moving files, but
sometimes things can go out of sync and in that case it's best to simply
reset the editor using `Window: Reload` command.

## Failed to Update

This can happen particularly on windows ([relevant
issue](https://github.com/TypeStrong/atom-typescript/issues/195)) as it
is not possible to delete a file if it is executing. Close all atom
instances and run the following commands:

    apm uninstall atom-typescript
    apm install atom-typescript

## Failed to install

Follow the same steps as specified in failed to update.
